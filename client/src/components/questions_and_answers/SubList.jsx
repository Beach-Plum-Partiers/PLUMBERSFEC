        - On click, this button will open the Add answer modal

      -After this on a new line, the answers will be listed in this order:
        - Seller(bold) -> highest rated(descending) up to 2 questions
        - These will be either taken in this file or in a future Answers.jsx

      - At the bottom there will be a button reading "See more Answers"
        - On click, this button will expand the list up untill the screen is filled
        - Then the window will be scrollable
        -The button will then be replaced by a collapse button that will revert changes
