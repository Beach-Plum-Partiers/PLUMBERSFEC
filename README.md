## Description

FEC Atelier is a full-stack web application developed to replicate the experience of a physical atelier, where people can browse and purchase custom-made products. It was built using React, Amazon AWS, Express.js, Jest, Node.js, MySQL, and Sequelize.

The application allows users to view products, create accounts, add items to their carts, and purchase items. It also enables admins to create new products, remove existing products, and manage orders.

## To make new branch:
  ### Step 1: Clone the master repo(if you haven't already, if you have then skip to step 2)
  ```
   > git clone <url of master repo>
  ```
  ### Step 2: Create new Branch
  ```
   > git branch <name of new branch>
  ```
  ### Step 3: Go to new Branch
  ```
   > git checkout <name of new branch>
  ```
  ### Step 4: Make sure you are in new branch
  ```
   > git branch
  ```
   You should see something like this:
   ```
   > git branch
      master
      *<name of new branch>
   ```
  ### Step 5: Rebasing and merging into branches
  Stash work before doing so
  ```
  > git stash
  ```
  Move to branch
  ```
  > git checkout main (whater your main branch in called)
  ```
  Pull down from GH
  ```
  > git pull origin main
  ```
  Move to branch and merge
  ```
  > git checkout 'BRANCH_NAME'

  > git merge main
  ```
  Now head to VSCode to resolve conflict issues for rebase

  After rebase merge is complete, reload in stashed items
  ```
  > git stash list (to view what will be added back in)
  > git stash pop (to add back to branch)
  ```
